            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>REPLY</hi> of the Country to the kind Reasons of the great City, for a general Liberty to the Clothiers for selling their Cloth when, where, and as they please,</head>
            <opener>Humbly Offer'd to the PARLIAMENT.</opener>
            <p>VVHen so general an Application hath been made for three or four years to this Honourable House by the Clothiers of <hi>Gloucester-shire, Wilts, Somerset, Berks, Warwick-shire,</hi> &amp;c. by Petitions and Letters to the Members, to regain their lost right at the publick Market of <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> where alone they have a free liberty to sell their Cloth; and by which means solely, they can be redeem'd from the more than <hi>Egyptian Bondage</hi> they are brought into by the conjunct interest of the <hi>Turky Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> and <hi>Packers.</hi> It seems a more than ordinary Imposition upon this great Council (after their Practice has past the Censure of a Committee) to shelter the extraordinary advantage they gain from the Country, under a specious pretence of Favour to the little Clothiers, as if they were totally uncapable of understanding their own Interest.</p>
            <p>The Reasons are flourish'd (like a Citizen) in the beginning, with Bodies Politick, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Natural; to which I shall only answer, That the Bodies Politick in the City, hath made many Natural Bodies very Poor in the Country; and come to the first Lyon in the way, <hi>That all sudden alterations in Trade are dangerous,</hi> which I am sure, is not so fierce as its painted. The Clothiers are now obliged by the City Law, to bring their Cloth to <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> and there pay a Duty; as likewise restrained from selling them in Inns and publick Houses, which doth denote some advantage to the Clothiers at this publick Market. Here are more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Warehouses to lodge Cloth than in any private House, and more secure from Fire, which at present are other ways employ'd; and if this Cloth be bought by the Merchant, and sent into his own House instead of the Packers, it will be a means to have it Exported the Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and no loss to the publick, if their withdrawing Rooms were once more turn'd into Warehouses, and the old Cloth Perches were put up in their Coach-houses again: Hereby Apprentices will be brought up to a due knowledge in Cloth, which will beget a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Trade; and the old Proverb was, <hi>A Man's own business never dirts his Fingers.</hi> But supposing this to be inconsistent with the new Equipage and Gallantry, it is the same to send Cloth into the Packers Houses when bought, as now to send Cloth there to sell; and many hath used Spectacles so long, that the Servant, the Packer, lately Fin'd for Sheriff, when the Master desir'd to be excus'd. As our matters now stand, the saving all unnecessary Charge seems most agreeable to the Constitution of our Body Politick; and this dangerous Alteration will be converted into the Security of the Clothier, by avoiding two Hazards in three that he now runs in the Sale of his Cloth; and his present case is directly contrary to what is suggested; for he now scarce ever knows when his Cloth is sold, to whom it was sold, or at what price; which in great measure will be redrest by this Bill. The greatest Happiness that this Nation ever enjoy'd, came lately in a sudden Alteration; when our lost Rights were restored: And I am sure, that private Interest in Trade hath as much invaded the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good of our Nation, as the Jesuit in Religion.</p>
            <p>The next Position is, <hi>That if Cloth is sold at the publick Market, none but the rich Clothiers can Trade.</hi> If the little Clothier can't sell his Cloth himself, which in former days was very usual, he hath a Factor ready at hand to sell them for him, the first opportunity. A Liberty to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Hall-keeper to deliver them to a Merchant that is his Friend; when his occasions prompt him to take them at his Price, or otherwise if transacted by Letter; or if he hath a mind to put them up in a Store-house, the Bank hath offer'd to lend Mony upon easie Terms for the Relief of the Poor: So that this is evidently the advantage of all little Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers. And if the necessity of our Affairs should require an Excise out of our home Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, this is no way to be Collected, but by preserving the Sale in publick Markets. <hi>Small quantities will then be sold for Exportation, and at far dearer Rates than the now Prices.</hi> To answer this, I will only add his own words: <hi>When the Merchant at one view sees the many unsold Cloths in the publick Market, he will be so far from giving more, that he will probably give less than he non gives.</hi> — And this being laid down last, like a bequeath in a Will, it must take place of the former: <hi>The more Markets, the more Buyers,</hi> in this case is no maxim; for the Packers Houses are no Markets; they keep their Doors lockt, and no Lettices, or other Signs that Cloth is there to be sold; but indeed, rather so many private Monopolies, to which belongs some Favorite Merchants. More Houses than one are let out to Packers by Merchants, that they may thereby command the better Penniworths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit is the Life of Trade:</hi> I have often heard, that ready Mony is the Life of Trade; I am sure that drives it the quickest round; which seems to have more Life than Credit.</p>
            <p>The Clothier is not hereby restrained from giving Credit with his Cloth, and the Packer may buy and sell again for what Credit he pleaseth; but it can't but be thought hard to all Mankind, that a Clothier should be forc'd upon a hazardous Credit, beyond his own Ability, and his Family want imployment in the mean time, and the Poor ready to Starve. <hi>Light Gain makes a heavy Purse,</hi> is the Language of ready mony, and nor Credit; and hereby our Woollen Manufacture will be Exported much the Cheaper, which will encourage the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. A publick Market doth always encourage a good Commodity; and until our Cloth is truer made, our Trade can never mend. The Sums of Mony chearfully paid by the Country, the present regret that there is not a better Ability to do more to assist the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which evidently springs from the loss of our Wool, the extraordinary Charge to the Relief of our Poor, and the Oppression in Trade by those that drink Claret in Quarts; and the neglect in a long Application, where Relief may be expected, are Considerations that are strangely dis-spiriting to multitudes of his Majesties Trading Subjects, are humbly offered to the Consideration of this Honourable House.</p>
